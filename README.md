# swaggerExample
Small project trying out Swagger api documentation

# How to Run
- In the directory where the files are located, run npm install.  This will install the express, nodemon, swagger-jsdoc, and swagger-ui-express dependencies.
- Next, run npm start (this uses a script in the package.json file, referring to nodemon as the start script).
- In a web browser, browse to localhost:4000/api-docs
- You'll see an interface for "get" and "post"
- To use the "post", enter a parameter in JSON, such as {"title": "Matilda: The Musical"}
